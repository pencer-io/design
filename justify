	1. Identify Security Requirements:
		○ Risk Management Plan: Review your risk management plan to identify critical assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and their associated risks.
		○ Organizational Policies: Adhere to any security policies your organization has in place regarding data privacy, access control, and incident response.
		○ Compliance Regulations: Identify any applicable laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS) that dictate specific security requirements for your system.
	2. Prioritize Threats and Vulnerabilities:
		○ Likelihood and Impact: Analyze the likelihood of each threat occurring and the potential impact it could have on your system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).
		○ Risk Matrix: Use a risk matrix to categorize threats based on their likelihood and impact. Focus on addressing high-risk threats first.
	3. Access Control Mechanisms:
		○ Authentication: Implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. Consider options like multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
		○ Authorization: Enforce authorization controls to grant users access to specific resources and functionalities based on their roles and permissions (principle of least privilege).
	4. Evaluate Existing Security Controls:
		○ Review Implemented Controls: Evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls (firewalls, IDS, encryption) in mitigating identified risks.
		○ Gap Analysis: Identify any gaps or weaknesses in your current security posture based on the risk analysis.
	5.  Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:
		○ Backup and Recovery: Develop a comprehensive backup and recovery plan to ensure quick restoration of data and system functionality in case of disasters or outages.
		○ Business Continuity: Implement a business continuity plan to minimize downtime and ensure critical business processes can continue even during disruptions.
	6. Mitigate Security Risks:
		○ Develop a Remediation Plan: Based on the gap analysis, develop a plan to address identified security weaknesses. This might involve: 
			§ Implementing additional security controls.
			§ Strengthening existing controls through configuration adjustments.
			§ Updating software and patching vulnerabilities promptly.
		○ Justification: Document the rationale for chosen mitigation strategies, explaining how they address specific threats and vulnerabilities.
	7. Explain Design Decisions:
		○ Rationale Report: Create a report that explains the rationale behind the security design choices made. This report should include: 
			§ Security requirements based on the risk management plan, policies, and regulations.
			§ Prioritization of threats and vulnerabilities.
			§ Chosen access control mechanisms and justification for their selection.
			§ Evaluation of existing controls and mitigation strategies for identified gaps.
			§ Disaster recovery and business continuity plans.

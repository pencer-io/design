1. Risk Assessment Plan:
	• Identify Assets: Catalog all critical assets within your web application system, including data (customer information, financial records), applications, and infrastructure components.
	• Threat Identification: Leverage the threats identified earlier (e.g., SQL injection, ransomware, stolen credentials) and consider additional threats relevant to your application and industry.
	• Vulnerability Assessment: Review the vulnerabilities identified through vulnerability assessment tools, manual testing, and code review.
	• Likelihood and Impact: For each threat-vulnerability pair, assess the likelihood of the threat occurring (based on exploit availability and attacker motivation) and the potential impact (data loss, financial damage, reputational harm) if successful.
	• Risk Prioritization: Prioritize risks based on their likelihood and impact using a risk matrix. Focus on addressing high-risk threats first.
2. Assurance Strategy with Controls:
	• Mapping Controls to Threats: Develop a control matrix that maps specific security controls to mitigate each identified threat.
	• Control Examples:
		○ Web Application Firewall (WAF): Mitigates web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
		○ Strong Password Policies and MFA: Reduces the risk of unauthorized access through stolen credentials.
		○ Regular Backups and Patching: Enables recovery from ransomware attacks and protects against newly discovered vulnerabilities.
		○ Security Awareness Training: Educates employees on cybersecurity best practices and helps them identify phishing attempts.
		○ Incident Response Plan: Establishes a clear procedure for responding to security incidents, minimizing damage and recovery time.
3. Control Testing:
	• Penetration Testing: Schedule periodic penetration testing by a qualified professional to validate the effectiveness of implemented controls and identify any remaining vulnerabilities.
	• Vulnerability Scans: Regularly conduct vulnerability scans using automated tools to identify newly discovered vulnerabilities and ensure existing controls remain effective.
4. Incident Response Procedures:
	• Detection and Reporting: Define a process for detecting security incidents (e.g., intrusion attempts, suspicious activity logs). Establish clear procedures for reporting incidents to the security team.
	• Containment: Develop strategies to contain an incident, such as isolating compromised systems or revoking compromised credentials.
	• Investigation and Eradication: Outline a plan for investigating the incident to determine its scope and root cause. Implement steps to eradicate the threat and prevent future occurrences.
	• Recovery: Establish a disaster recovery plan to restore affected systems and data from backups in a timely manner.
	• Communication and Post-Incident Review: Define communication protocols for informing stakeholders (management, customers) about security incidents. Conduct a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and improve your security posture.
Maintaining Assurance:
	• Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor your system for suspicious activity and emerging threats.
	• Security Awareness: Regularly provide security awareness training to employees to keep them updated on evolving threats and best practices.
	• Regular Reviews: Periodically review and update your risk assessment and assurance strategy based on new threats, vulnerabilities, and changes to your system.

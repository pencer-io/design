Data Protection Laws and Regulations:
	• General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): If your organization operates in the EU or handles data of EU citizens, GDPR compliance is crucial. GDPR mandates reporting data breaches to affected individuals and relevant authorities within specific timeframes.
	• Other Regulations: Review industry-specific regulations or national data protection laws that might apply to your organization and the type of data affected (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare data).
Privacy and Confidentiality:
	• Minimize Data Collection: During the incident response, only collect data necessary for investigation and recovery.
	• Data Anonymization: Consider anonymizing collected data when possible to protect user privacy.
	• Access Controls: Restrict access to investigation data to authorized personnel with a need-to-know basis.
Industry Standards:
	• National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework: The NIST framework provides guidance for incident response, including identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery.

Incident Response Plan
Team Roles and Responsibilities:
	• Incident Response Team: Establish a team with representatives from IT security, legal, communications, and potentially human resources.
	• Incident Commander: Designate an incident commander to lead the response and make critical decisions.
	• Team Member Roles: Define specific roles and responsibilities for each team member (e.g., evidence collection, forensics, communication with stakeholders).
Data Collection and Analysis Procedures:
	• Data Preservation: Outline procedures for preserving potential evidence, including logs, system images, and affected user data.
	• Chain of Custody: Maintain a clear chain of custody for all collected evidence to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings if necessary.
	• Forensics Tools: Define the use of forensics tools like Autopsy for data analysis, ensuring they are used according to relevant legal and ethical guidelines.
Privacy and Confidentiality Measures:
	• Data Minimization: Document procedures for collecting only the minimum data required for investigation.
	• Data Anonymization: Outline strategies for anonymizing collected data whenever possible to protect user privacy.
	• Data Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect collected data from unauthorized access or disclosure.
Additional Considerations:
	• Communication Plan: Develop a communication plan to inform stakeholders (management, customers) about the breach in a timely and transparent manner.
	• Law Enforcement: Consider involving law enforcement authorities if the incident involves criminal activity.
	• Lessons Learned: Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in your security posture and incident response procedures.

Autopsy Software Configuration:
	• Data Source Selection: Configure Autopsy to analyze the type of data affected in the simulated attack (e.g., disk images, network logs, memory dumps).
	• Legal and Ethical Compliance: Ensure Autopsy configuration is compliant with your organization's data retention policies and relevant legal requirements for data handling.
	• User Permissions: Set up user permissions in Autopsy to restrict access to sensitive data based on the need-to-know principle.
Preliminary Investigation:
	• Data Collection: Use Autopsy to collect relevant data from affected systems (e.g., disk images, logs) while adhering to data preservation and chain of custody principles.
	• Data Analysis: Analyze collected data using Autopsy's features to identify potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) and the scope of the breach.
	• Identify Affected Data: Determine what type of data was compromised (e.g., customer information, financial records) based on the investigation.
Case Creation and Documentation:
	• Case Creation in Autopsy: Create a dedicated case file within Autopsy to organize all investigation data, evidence, and analysis findings.
	• Timeline of Events: Document a detailed timeline of events leading up to the security breach, including initial detection, investigation steps, and mitigation actions taken.
	• Investigation Documentation: Use Autopsy's reporting features to document all aspects of the investigation, including data collection procedures, analysis results, and mitigation strategies.

Develop a mitigation plan and an Information Security Management Plan (ISMS).
1. Mitigation Plan:
The mitigation plan should address the identified risks with prioritized recommendations for improving security. Here's a breakdown of key areas:
Controls:
	• Technical Controls:
		○ Implement Network Segmentation to isolate the exercise platform from other internal systems.
		○ Deploy an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
		○ Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the exercise platform and network devices to identify and patch vulnerabilities promptly.
		○ Enforce strong password policies for user access to the platform.
	• Procedural Controls:
		○ Develop a detailed incident response plan for the cyber exercise, outlining procedures for identifying, containing, and recovering from security incidents. This plan should include clear roles and responsibilities for response personnel.
		○ Conduct user awareness training for participants on cybersecurity best practices, including identifying phishing attempts and social engineering tactics.
		○ Implement a change management process to manage updates and modifications to the exercise platform and network infrastructure with minimal security risks.
	• Management Controls:
		○ Develop an Information Security Policy (ISP) specifically for the cyber exercise, outlining the organization's commitment to security and expectations for user behavior.
		○ Review and update the existing security policies (e.g., password policy, acceptable use policy) to ensure they reflect the specific requirements of the cyber exercise.
2. Prioritization:
Prioritize the recommendations based on two key factors:
	• Impact: Consider the potential impact of a successful exploit for each identified risk. Risks with higher potential impact (e.g., data breach, disruption of service) warrant higher priority mitigation efforts.
	• Feasibility: Evaluate the feasibility of implementing each recommendation. Some controls might require significant resources or expertise, while others might be easier and quicker to implement.
3. Implementation Plan:
Develop a detailed implementation plan that outlines:
	• Timelines: Set realistic timelines for implementing each mitigation recommendation.
	• Responsibilities: Assign clear ownership for implementing each recommendation to specific individuals or teams.
	• Resources: Identify the resources required for implementation, including budget allocations, personnel, and any necessary training.
Integration with ISMS:
These mitigation strategies and implementation plans should be integrated into a broader Information Security Management Plan (ISMS) for BanX. The ISMS will provide a comprehensive framework for managing cybersecurity risks across the organization, including the cyber exercise network.
Benefits of an ISMS:
	• Proactive approach to security risk management
	• Improved communication and collaboration on security matters
	• Demonstrates commitment to information security and regulatory compliance

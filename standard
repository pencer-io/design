Choosing a Framework:
Several recognized cybersecurity frameworks
	• NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): A voluntary framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) providing a high-level structure for managing cybersecurity risk. It offers a good starting point with its five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
	• ISO/IEC 27001: An international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a more comprehensive approach with detailed requirements for implementing and maintaining effective security controls.
	• CIS Controls: A prioritized set of cybersecurity controls developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). These controls are specifically designed to defend against a wide range of cyber threats.

Risk Assessment Process:
Following the NIST CSF structure:
1. Identify:
	• Assets: Identify critical assets involved in the exercise, including:
		○ Exercise Platform Server
		○ MPLS Network Devices
		○ Participant Devices
		○ User Data (exercise registration, etc.)
	• Threats: Identify potential threats based on the identified vulnerabilities and threat modeling:
		○ MitM attacks
		○ DoS attacks
		○ Zero-day exploits
		○ Insider threats (accidental or intentional)
2. Protect:
	• Review and assess the existing security controls implemented based on the network design:
		○ Network segmentation
		○ Strong encryption
		○ Secure configuration of network devices and server
		○ User access controls
		○ Patch management
3. Detect:
	• Evaluate the effectiveness of existing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) for monitoring network traffic for malicious activity.
4. Respond:
	• Assess the organization's incident response plan:
		○ Does it have a clear process for identifying, containing, and recovering from security incidents during the exercise?
		○ Are there designated personnel responsible for incident response?
5. Recover:
	• Evaluate the organization's disaster recovery plan:
		○ Can the exercise platform and network be quickly restored in case of a major outage?
		○ Are backups regularly performed for critical data?

Gap Analysis and Recommendations:
Based on the assessment, identify any gaps in security posture and recommend improvements:
	• Implement IDS/IPS if not already deployed.
	• Conduct vulnerability scans of the exercise platform and network devices.
	• Develop a specific incident response plan for the cyber exercise, including communication protocols and escalation procedures.
	• Test the disaster recovery plan to ensure its effectiveness.
Benefits of using a Standardized Framework:
	• Provides a structured and repeatable approach to risk assessment.
	• Ensures alignment with best practices in cybersecurity.
	• Allows for benchmarking against other organizations.

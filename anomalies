Monitoring Tools:
	• Network Traffic Monitoring (NTM): Utilize network monitoring tools to track network activity in real-time. Tools like Wireshark or dedicated network traffic analysis (NTA) solutions can be used to capture and analyze network traffic for anomalies.
	• Log Management: Collect and analyze logs from network devices, servers, and the exercise platform. This can provide valuable insights into user activity and potential security incidents.
	• Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Deploy IDS/IPS on the network to detect and block malicious traffic patterns associated with known attacks.
Anomaly Detection:
	• Leverage network traffic analysis tools and log analysis to identify deviations from expected behavior during the exercise. This can include:
		○ Unusual data transfer volumes
		○ Unauthorized access attempts
		○ Deviations from standard communication protocols
		○ High error rates or unusual login patterns
Responding to Anomalies:
	• Establish clear procedures for investigating and responding to identified anomalies.
	• Develop a dedicated team responsible for monitoring security alerts and taking appropriate action.
	• This might involve isolating suspicious activity, investigating potential breaches, or notifying relevant authorities.
Recognizing Anomalous Behaviors:
	• Baseline Behavior: Before the exercise, establish a baseline for user activity and network traffic patterns. This will help identify deviations during the actual event.
	• Threat Intelligence: Stay updated on the latest cyber threats and attack methods relevant to the exercise platform and targeted systems. Analyze traffic patterns for known malicious behavior indicators.
User Education: Train participants on the exercise platform and expected behavior during the simulation. Encourage them to report any suspicious activity they encounter.

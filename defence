	1. Ensure AV software with Real-Time Scanning is active on all endpoints. This can detect and block malware attempts during extraction.
	2. Consider disabling automatic script execution for file types commonly used in malware, like Executables (.exe), JavaScript (.js) or VBScript (.vbs) through the Windows Registry Editor.
	3. PowerShell Execution Policy should be set to "Restricted", which prevents any scripts from running by default. 
	4. Educate employees about the risks of opening unknown zip files, especially from untrusted sources. Train them to verify the sender and file content before opening.

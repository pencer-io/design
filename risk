	1. Perform a Risk Analysis:
		○ Identify Assets: List all critical assets of the system, including hardware, software, data, and user information.
		○ Threat Identification: Brainstorm potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in your system. Consider:
			§ External Threats: Hackers, malware attacks, phishing attempts.
			§ Internal Threats: Accidental data leaks, unauthorized access by employees.
			§ Natural Disasters: Power outages, flooding.
		○ Vulnerability Assessment: Analyze identified assets to identify potential vulnerabilities that threats could exploit.
		○ Impact Assessment: Estimate the potential impact of each threat on the system's assets. This includes:
			§ Confidentiality: Could data be accessed by unauthorized individuals?
			§ Integrity: Could data be tampered with or modified?
			§ Availability: Could the system be unavailable to authorized users?
		○ Likelihood Assessment: Estimate the likelihood of each threat occurring based on historical data, industry trends, and your specific context.
	2. Evaluate Security Controls:
		○ Review Implemented Controls: List all security controls you have implemented in your web application and network infrastructure. These might include:
			§ Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Anti-Virus Software
			§ Secure Coding Practices, User Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
			§ Encryption (Data at Rest and In Transit) and Key Management
			§ Security Policies and Procedures
		○ Control Effectiveness: Evaluate how effectively each control mitigates the identified risks. This involves analyzing if the control:
			§ Addresses the specific vulnerability or threat.
			§ Reduces the likelihood or impact of the threat.
	3. Develop a Risk Management Plan:
		○ Prioritize Risks: Based on the risk analysis, prioritize risks based on their likelihood and impact. Focus on addressing high-risk vulnerabilities first.
		○ Risk Mitigation Strategies: Develop specific strategies to address each risk. These strategies might involve:
			§ Implementing additional security controls
			§ Improving existing controls
			§ Accepting the risk if the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact
		○ Risk Treatment Plan: Define a plan for implementing the chosen risk mitigation strategies. This includes assigning responsibilities, timelines, and budget considerations.
		○ Monitoring and Review: Establish procedures for continuously monitoring the system's security posture and reviewing the risk management plan. Regularly update the plan as needed based on new threats, vulnerabilities, or security control effectiveness.
	Example:
	Consider the potential threat of a hacker injecting malicious SQL code (SQL injection attack) into a login form. This could exploit a vulnerability in the application code and grant unauthorized access to the database.
		○ Security Control: Implement secure coding practices to validate and sanitize user input, preventing SQL injection attacks.
		○ Control Effectiveness: This control directly addresses the identified vulnerability and significantly reduces the likelihood of a successful SQL injection attack.

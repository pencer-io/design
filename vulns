1. Define Threat Scope:
	• Company Assets: Collaborate with the company to understand their critical assets (data, systems, applications) and their network architecture.
	• Industry Threats: Research common threats targeting their industry sector (e.g., financial institutions face different threats than healthcare providers).
2. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering:
	• Social Media Monitoring:
		○ Track relevant hashtags, keywords, and competitor mentions on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
		○ Identify discussions or rumors about potential attacks or vulnerabilities related to the company's industry or software they use.
		○ Utilize tools like Hootsuite or Sprout Social for advanced social listening.
	• Dark Web Monitoring:
		○ Engage with specialized threat intelligence firms that monitor dark web forums, marketplaces, and hacker chat rooms.
		○ These forums might contain discussions about upcoming attacks, exploits for known vulnerabilities, or stolen data that could be relevant to the company.
		○ Caution: Navigating the dark web requires expertise and security precautions to avoid malware or scams. Consider leaving this to specialized firms.
	• Industry Publications and Security Blogs:
		○ Subscribe to security blogs, forums, and publications relevant to the company's industry and technology stack.
		○ Stay updated on newly discovered vulnerabilities, attack trends, and mitigation strategies.
	• Government and Industry Reports:
		○ Review security reports published by government cybersecurity agencies (e.g., CISA in the US, NCSC in the UK) and industry organizations.
		○ These reports often contain valuable insights into emerging threats and best practices for defense.
3. Threat Intelligence Feeds:
	• Commercial Threat Feeds: Consider subscribing to commercial threat intelligence feeds from reputable security vendors.
		○ These feeds provide real-time or daily updates on new threats, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and malicious URLs.
	• Free Threat Intelligence Feeds: Explore free threat intelligence feeds from open-source communities or security researchers.
		○ While not as comprehensive as commercial feeds, they can still provide valuable insights.
4. Vulnerability Management Tools:
	• Implement vulnerability scanning tools to identify known weaknesses in the company's network infrastructure and applications.
	• Regularly update these tools to ensure they detect the latest vulnerabilities.
5. Utilizing Collected Intelligence:
	• Centralized Repository: Maintain a central repository to store and analyze the collected threat intelligence data.
	• Threat Analysis: Analyze the collected information to identify potential attack vectors, exploit trends, and the actors behind these threats.
	• Prioritization: Prioritize identified threats based on their likelihood and potential impact on the company's critical assets.

Company Assets: 
	• Servers hosting customer databases and financial information
	• Internal network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls)
	• Web applications used by customers and employees
	• Remote access points for employee access
Industry: (Replace with the specific industry)
	• Financial Services
Threat Intelligence Findings:
	• Social media discussions about a new exploit targeting a specific web application framework used by the company.
	• Dark web marketplace listing stolen credentials for a popular cloud provider used by the company.
	• Industry report highlighting an increase in ransomware attacks targeting financial institutions.

Vulnerability Assessment Process:
	1. Scanning:
		○ Automated Scanners: Utilize automated vulnerability scanners like Acunetix, Nessus, or OpenVAS to identify common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
		○ Configuration Review: Manually review the configuration of your web server, application server, and database to identify potential security misconfigurations.
	2. Manual Penetration Testing:
		○ Ethical Hacker Simulates Attack: Engage a security professional or use a penetration testing platform to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
		○ Focus on Identified Threats: Prioritize testing based on the threats identified in your threat model.
	3. Code Review:
		○ Static Code Analysis: Use static code analysis tools (SAST) like SASTify, Fortify, or CodeClimate to identify potential coding errors and security vulnerabilities within your application code.
		○ Manual Code Review: Conduct manual code reviews to identify logic flaws or insecure coding practices that could be exploited by attackers.
Resources for Vulnerability Assessment:
	• OWASP Top 10: The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 provides a list of the most critical web application security risks. Focus on testing for these vulnerabilities first: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
	• National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a guide for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents: https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework

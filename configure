	1. Configuration:
		a. User Accounts and Permissions:
			§ Create separate user accounts for students with limited privileges. Avoid using administrator accounts for everyday tasks.
			§ Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to grant permissions based on user roles (e.g., instructor, student).
			§ Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added login security.
		b. Password Policies:
			§ Enforce strong password policies with minimum length, character complexity requirements, and regular password changes.
			§ Implement password lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
		c. Firewall Settings:
			§ Configure firewalls to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.
			§ Block unnecessary ports and services to minimize the attack surface.
			§ Allow only authorized traffic for course lab activities.
		d. System Updates:
			§ Enable automatic updates for the operating system and installed software to patch vulnerabilities promptly.
			§ Configure a system for testing updates in a non-production environment before deploying them to student labs.
	2. Security Policy:
		a. Develop a Document: Create a clear and concise security policy document outlining the rules and regulations for accessing and using the course lab system. This should include:
			§ Acceptable use policy for data and software access.
			§ Password management guidelines.
			§ Data backup and recovery procedures.
			§ Incident response plan for security breaches.
			§ Reporting procedures for suspicious activity.
		b. Policy Dissemination: Distribute the security policy to all instructors and students. Regularly review and update the policy as needed.
	3. Identifying Threats:
		a. Common Threats: 
			§ Malware and Viruses: These can spread through infected files or downloads.
			§ Phishing Attacks: Emails that trick users into revealing sensitive information.
			§ Zero-Day Attacks: Previously unknown vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.
			§ Social Engineering: Manipulation tactics to gain unauthorized access.
			§ Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Attempts to overwhelm the system with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
		b. Threat Assessment: Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify specific vulnerabilities in your system and prioritize mitigation strategies.
	4. Security Features:
		a. Encryption: Utilize disk encryption to protect sensitive data at rest on the servers hosting course lab VMs.
		b. VPNs: Consider using VPNs for secure remote access to the course lab system, especially for instructors.
		c. IDPS/IPS: If resources allow, implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS/IPS) to monitor and block suspicious network activity.
		d. Anti-Malware Software: Deploy anti-malware software on the server OS and potentially student lab VMs for additional protection. Consider disabling unnecessary features within the student VMs to further minimize attack surfaces.
